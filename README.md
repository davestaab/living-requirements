> Renders cucumber spec output as a living requirements suite 

## The Problem

How should your software work? How does it work? These seems like basic questions that should be simple to answer. 

But where do you go to know for sure? You might specifications but what if the spec docs are out of date? How do you know if they're still accurate? How do you know old requirements still hold as new features are added? How do you know nothing broke after code is refactored? What is there's a dispute about how it should work or does work?

These are all questions that can be answered by Behavior Driven Design (BDD) methodology and the Cucumber tool feature development. 

### Discovery

Most people learn about software by using it. Even developers have to refer to the   

So by definition 

How do you know what it can do? How do you learn about features? What is you don't access to a feature?

### Verification
 

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```
